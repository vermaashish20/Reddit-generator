# Introducing

## Features
- **Automatic captcha bypass**: The script automatically solves captchas during the account creation process.
- **Automatic email verification**: The script automatically verifies the email address used for the account.
- **Proxy Support**: Since reddit allows you to create 1 account per IP every 10 minutes, this is very important.
- **Resilience**: The script is able to handle most errors that may occur during the account creation process.

## Quick info

Firefox should be installed on your system for the script to work.

It is recommended to use proxies, because you can only create 1 account per IP in 10 minutes. See file **proxies.txt** or run `python run_tor.py`

To access the auto-generated email, visit https://1secmail.com

If you are not using your email, you should not show anyone the email address generated by the program. Having the address of this email, anyone can access it.

## TODO:
- [x] Add automatic browser driver download
- [x] Add Tor support for easier proxy management
- [x] Make this a python package
- [x] Automatic email verification
- [ ] Handle error when sub is not available

# Getting started

> **Note** Python 3.7+ is required

## Script installation

1. Clone this repository to your local machine:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cubicbyte/reddit-account-generator.git
cd reddit-account-generator
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```shell
pip install -r requirements-cli.txt
```

## Script usage

> **Note** **Firefox should be installed on your system for the script to work**

> **Note** **You need to use Tor (not browser) or proxy, because you can only create 1 account per IP in 10 minutes**

#### Using Tor (recommended for beginners)
Run this command and follow the instructions:
```shell
python run_tor.py
```

#### Using proxies
Add your proxies to the proxies.txt file

### Configuring

Configuring is not needed. But if you want, you can change the settings in the [config.py](config.py) file.

### Starting

1. Run the script:

```shell
python create_accounts.py
```

2. Enter the number of accounts you want to create
3. Sit back and relax while the script generates Reddit accounts for you :)

## Package installation

There are two ways to install the library:

- Installation using pip (a Python package manager):

```shell
pip install reddit-account-generator
```

- Installation from source (requires git):

```shell
git clone https://github.com/cubicbyte/reddit-account-generator.git
cd reddit-account-generator
python setup.py install
```

or:

```shell
pip install git+https://github.com/eternnoir/pyTelegramBotAPI.git
```

It is generally recommended to use the first option.

Update package:

```shell
pip install reddit-account-generator --upgrade
```

## Package Usage Example

```python
from reddit_account_generator import create_account, protect_account, install_driver

# Install browser driver
install_driver()

email = 'your-email@gmail.com'
username = 'PolishCardinal69'
password = '31vV3X1zy8YP'

# Create account
create_account(email, username, password)

# Protect account from being suspended of being a bot
protect_account(username, password)

# Done!
```

Using proxy:

```python
from reddit_account_generator import create_account, protect_account, install_driver
from reddit_account_generator.proxies import TorProxy

email = 'your-email@gmail.com'
# Username and password will be generated automatically

proxy = TorProxy(TOR_IP, TOR_PORT, TOR_PASSWORD, TOR_CONTROL_PORT, TOR_DELAY)

uname, pwd = create_account(email, proxy=proxy.get_next())
protect_account(username=uname, password=pwd)  # Proxy not required
```
